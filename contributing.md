How to Communicate:

GitHub Issues

A bit more formal way of communication with fellow Redox devs, but a little less quick and convenient like the chat. 
Submit an issue when you run into problems compiling, testing, or just would like to discuss a certain topic, be it features, code style, 
code inconsistencies, minor changes and fixes, etc.

Pull Requests

It's fine to just submit a small pull request without first making an issue, but if it's a significant change that will require a lot of planning and reviewing.
